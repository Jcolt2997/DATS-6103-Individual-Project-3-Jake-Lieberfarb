    "The Alliance of Community Health Plans (ACHP) is an advocacy and health care firm located in Washington, D.C. ACHP represents 23 healthcare providers around the US. An analysis was conducted on the types of healthcare plan types available in the US and for ACHP members. Plan types use a system of ratings called \"Stars\" to evaluate 9 overall measures and 46 different quality measures.Each quality measure is given a rating from 1-5 with 5 being the highest. These ratings are known as \"Star ratings\". They measure the experiences Medicare beneficiaries have with their healthcare system and health plan. The 46 quality measures are broken down into four groups. For \"HD\" there are five criteria that rate the overall healthcare experience. There are four \"DD\" rates the overall drug availability. For example, \"DD4\" measures 'Drug Safety and Accuracy of Drug Pricing' of a plan. There are 32 \"C\" rates which measure the clinical aspect of a plan. C03 refers to the availabiliyt of an individual to get the annual flu vaccine. Finally, there are 14 \"D\" ratings which measures drug availabilities in a plan. All of this information was obtained from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). [Monthly Enrollment by Plan](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/Monthly-Enrollment-by-Plan) contains Medicare enrollment by plan contract and plan type. Next, the [2021 Star Ratings Data Table (Oct 08 2020) (ZIP)](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription-Drug-Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/PerformanceData) was included in the analysis as it contains the 9 overall and 46 measure ratings by plan contract. The [Monthly MA Enrollment by State/County/Contract](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/Monthly-MA-Enrollment-by-State-County-Contract) was included in the analysis as it contains Medicare enrollment by plan contract and county (FIPS code). The months of October and November were selected to see types of contracts added per month. These files were merged for all plans in the US and ACHP member plans. Finally, social risk factor data (% uninsured, % unemployed, or % Fair or Poor Health) was included on the county level from [Countyhealthrankings.org](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation) to see if any ACHP members are providing plans for areas with high social risk factors."

    "There were significanlty more contracts added in October than in November. However, in both cases, HMO was the most common type. When looking at the highest average rating of plan types by Quality Measure, HMOs and 1876 cost appear to have high ratings for each quality measure. However, there is still a wide variety of plan types that offer different levels are ratings. When looking at the percent of fours and fives star ratings by plan type,  HMOs, Local PPOs, and Regional PPOs offer the wides range of coverage and overall have a majority of stars that are fours and fives. 1876 Cost has the most quality scores that are only fours and fives but still does not have as much variety as HMOs and local and Regional PPOs.  HMO/HMOPOS has the least number of quality measure offered as part of its plan type and least number of fours and fives ratings. "

These three risk scores were given the main focus in this analysis as they would be key criteria used in deciding if an ACHP member would want to take on the risk of providing insurance plans in this area. A choropleth map was included of social risk factors by state. A bar chart shows the counties and states with the highest social risk factors. Choropleth maps for the three risk factors was also constructed on the county level. A weighted stars value was constructed by taking the total number of enrollees available in each county and multiplying it by the overall star rating for each county and then summing the results for each county. A choropleth map for weighted stars by county was constructed to see if more urban or rural areas have different weighted stars. These charts are useful in understanding the spread of certain social risk factors such as finding the state with the most unemployed or uninsured. "

The state with the lowest percent of fair or poor health was Minnesota at 12.1324%. The top 10 counties with the highest % of fair or poor health were from Texas, Mississippi, and Alaska. The highest of which was Zavala, Texas at 40.9907%. For % Uninsured, the state choropleth map showed a trend of states in the Southeast to have the highest percentage. Specifically, Texas had 19.3911% and Georgia had 15.5302%. The states with the lowest percentage of uninsured was Hawaii at 4.6321% and Minnesota at 5.085%. When looking at the county level for percent unemployed  was Gaines, Texas at 33.7496%. For percent unemployed, there was no real recognizable pattern. the state with the highest unemployment was Alsaska at 6.5875% an West Virginia at 5.2556%. The state with the lowest unemployement was Hawaii at 2.4468% and Iowa at 2.5236%. The counties with the highest unemployment percentage was Kusilvak, Alaska at 19.9040% The county chropleth map shows that in general unemployment seems to be around no greater than 4%, but some states such as Arizona and Mississippi seem to have some counties with much higher rates of unemployment. The weighted stars choropleth has more urban counties with a higher weighted stars rating than more urban counties. By selecting \"4.5-5.0\" under the weighted stars legend, you would see that counties around Boston or San Francisco would disappear. If then select \"4.0-4.5\", you will notice that more rural counties disappear and this trend continues as you move down the weighted stars legend.  Most of the counties have stars ratings between 3.0-5.0. Overall, it appears that Texas has the highest percentage of social risk factors and Hawaii has the lowest.  "

County Choropleths were constructed for ACHP member weighted stars and the three social risk factors. bar charts were built to show which ACHP member has the most contracts to offer highly affected social risk counties. The count of ACHP contracts that serve more than 15% fair or poor health, 15% uninsured, and 5% unemployed was calculated to see if any ACHP members are taking on a greater social risk in the health plans they offer. Then each social risk was compared to the weighted stars on a scatter plot to see if there is any correlation between a weighted stars and increase in a specific social risk."

    "The weighted stars by county choropleth showed that ACHP members are mostly active on the west coast (California, Oregon, and Washington), North central( Minnesota and Wisconsin) and the Northeast(New England states and Pennsylvania). It appears that ACHP members are focusing more plans of nmetropolitan areas. For example, in texas, it appears that only the wider Dallas area has plans while the more rural counties do not. When looking at the count of ACHP member plans that serve more than 15% fair or poor health, UPMC has the most at seven, kaiser at six, Security at four, and Health Alliance at four. the scatter plot shows a weak to no correlation between % fair or poor health and weighted stars. the correlation value is 0.0553. Most of the wieghted stars can be found between 12 and 18% fair or poor health. For the count of ACHP member plans that have greater than 15% uninsured, Indendent has three, Communitycare has two, and Avmed, Kaiser, and Aultcare have one. The scatter plot shows a weak correlation between % uninsured and weighted ACHP member stars. Most of the ACHP contracts can be found between five and 10 percent uninsured.For the bar chart of count of ACHP member plans that serve areas greater than 5%, UPMC has five, Healthparters, Ucare, and Kaiser have three and Security has two. The scatterplot has a slightly higher correlation than the other risk factors at 0.1415 and most of the ACHP contracts can be found between three and five percent unemployed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the ACHP member plan who is servicing the most areas that have high social risk factors is Kaiser followed by HealthAlliance and Independent. Kaiser also has the highest 2021 Overall Stars rating, most quality scores that are either 4s or 5s, and the most health contracts of any ACHP member. The member plans that are not focusing on high social risk areas are CDPHD, Martinspoint, PacificSource, Fallon, and HarvardPilgrim. However, CDPHP and Martin's point did have a high star rating for their 2021 Overall quality measure Since the weighted stars has such a low correlation to social risk factors and the choropleth map showed a focus of ACHP member plans in metropolitian areas, It may be of useful to include percent of urban or rural in the weighted stars in a future analysis.  \n",
